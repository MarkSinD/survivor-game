It has multiple levels and hundreds
of game objects per level. The player must get from the start of the level, find and
then reach the exit. Fastest times are kept as high scores for each of the three levels.
However, there are also collectable coins scattered throughout the levels and a time
penalty is added on to the finish time for each one left uncollected. Precise jumps are
required, and the best route is not always obvious so a player wanting to do well will
need to explore and experiment. The whole level is not visible on screen all at once.
The level can be dozens of times the size of the screen, so exploration is required to
see the whole thing
